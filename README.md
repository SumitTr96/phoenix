## React

<!--=================BIO=================-->
This is a responsive react website using react version 18 and react router dom version 6. Throughout this project I have used react router 6 for routing, re-usable react components, react icons library, with react js best practices, and have used react hooks (useState), added easy contact options on website (Facebook messenger, WhatsApp, and email). Build responsive react website using css media queries, used CSS variables for easy theme customization, CSS transitions and keyframes, CSS3 flexbox and grid system, and more!
